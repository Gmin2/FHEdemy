# Hello FHEVM: Anonymous Survey Tutorial 📊

**The most beginner-friendly tutorial to build your first confidential dApp on FHEVM!**

Learn to create an **Anonymous Survey System** where users can submit private ratings while only aggregate results are public. Perfect for web3 developers new to Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand:
- ✅ **FHEVM basics** - Why confidential smart contracts matter
- ✅ **Complete dApp development** - Smart contract + React frontend  
- ✅ **Encryption workflow** - Client-side encryption → onchain computation → selective decryption
- ✅ **Real-world privacy** - Individual responses stay secret, only aggregates are revealed

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Try the Interactive Demo
```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd hello-fhevm-tutorial
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then visit:
- **`/playground`** - Interactive survey demo with code exploration
- **`/steps`** - Step-by-step narrative walkthrough

### What You'll Build

An **Anonymous Survey System** that demonstrates FHEVM's core value:

```
🔒 Private Input → 🔐 Encrypted Processing → 📊 Public Results
```

- **Users submit encrypted ratings** (1-10 scale)
- **Smart contract aggregates responses** without seeing individual votes  
- **Only statistical summaries** (average, count) are revealed
- **Complete anonymity** for all participants

## 🧠 Why This Tutorial?

### Perfect for Beginners
- **No crypto math required** - Focus on building, not theory
- **Real-world use case** - Everyone understands surveys
- **Clear privacy benefit** - Obvious why encryption matters
- **Complete example** - Full dApp, not just snippets

### Teaches Essential Concepts
1. **Client-side encryption** with fhevmjs
2. **Homomorphic computation** on encrypted data
3. **Access control** for selective decryption
